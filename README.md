# About React Web App Community

It is a community of learners learning web application development using React and associated technologies. 

The members learn through hands-on development and collaboration. 

# Why should you join it?

Running code is the ultimate truth. You can learn best by actually doing it. Doing it alone is boring. Doing it with a helpful and welcoming community is fun.

We would take projects where we gradually learn each group of related concepts and move to a higher level of complexity.

You can highlight your contribution in the project repository to get a job of your dream or get suitable promotions in existing employment, or you can just contribute to the fun of learning.

# How do I get started?

We would add more content to help the new comers to get started. The community projects are open and can be viewed anytime.

If you wish to contribute as a developer, please submit a request (https://github.com/react-web-apps/rwa-community-guidelines/issues/new) to add you as project member.

# Code of conduct

JAMStack code of conduct (https://jamstack.org/code-of-conduct/) is a fair representative until we draft our own.


# Communication Guidelines

* all project specific communication on GitHub issues.
* All general communication on React-Web-Apps (RWA) Telegram group.

# Architecture Design approach

Web applications can be designed and architected in multiple ways. In our community, we would take the most modern yet few standardized approaches to design web applications. Instead of learning many ways, we would take a few fundamentally correct yet architecturally sound ways and go as much deeper. 

Once we learn to solve the problem in one correct way, learning other approaches become very easy.

Below are the key technology stack that we would be using in developing web apps:

**Front-end app**

* Mobile first, responsive page layouts
* JAMStack architecture (https://jamstack.org/best-practices/)
* React based application architecture using next.js (nextjs.org) or Gatsby (gatsbyjs.com)
* OAuth2 based authentication
* PWA application
* Backend call using REST API or GraphQL

**Back-end app**

* Node.js based REST API or GraphQL server
* PostgreSQL database


# Project categories

* Static web sites using React
* PWA (Progressive Web Sites) 
* Static web sites generated using data files
* Server side rendered 


# TODO

* List of projects in each category
* Project status tracking
